# Haze-Removal-Algorithm-Using-Color-Attenuation-Prior

We implemented a dehazing algorithm described in "A Fast Single Image Haze Removal Algorithm Using Color Attenuation Prior" by Qingsong Zhu et al.

**Depth.py** file contains the code which takes a specified image from the image directory and processes it to generate the depthmap and finally the dehazed image

**images** directory includes some sample images to try the algorithm on.

**output** directory is where the code stores the generated and processed depthmaps at each stage.

The paper that is implemented in this project can be found here : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7128396
